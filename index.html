  <h2>Professional Self Assessment</h2>

<p class="prose">
    Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed a strong foundation
    in software development, problem-solving and professional communication. This ePortfolio represents my growth from learning
    individual concepts to designing and evaluating complete computing solutions using modern industry technologies.
    The work presented in this portfolio demonstrates not only my technical abilities and what I have learned but also my
    readiness to contribute within a professional environment. 

  </p>

  <p class="prose">
    As I progressed through the program, my approach to software development matured significantly. Early coursework focused on principles of programming with logic and syntax, while later courses required a deeper focus on architecture,
    efficiency, security and modularity for expansions. By applying structured design principles and evaluating trade offs between different implementation approaches, I learned to think beyond what was simply required to create the functional
    software but rather how it works and how it can be optimized. This progression prepared me to work with full stack technologies and real world development constraints.  
 
  </p>
  <p class="prose">
    Collaboration and communication are essential components of my academic experience. I worked within environments that emphasized peer feedback, shared decision making and clear documentation. Activities within the capstone project reflect this through the use of code reviews,
   version control and structured planning for future enhancements. This demonstrates my ability to effectively communicate technical concepts to diverse audiences. Producing a formal code review video and writing enhancement narratives have contributed to my professional ability
   to showcase different designs and functionality within a professional setting. 
 
  </p>
  <p class="prose">
   My technical competencies are demonstrated across software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
    From a software engineering perspective, I designed and enhanced an application using Node.js and Express,
    implementing modular architectures and RESTful routing to improve maintainability and scalability.
    Algorithmic enhancements required me to analyze data flow, apply appropriate data structures and consider efficiency and
    performance tradeoffs when evaluating solutions laid in front of me.
    
   </p>
  <p class="prose">
   Database integration was a key component of my capstone work. I utilized MongoDB as a NoSQL database solution and MongoDB Compass
    as a development and visualization tool to design schemas, manage collections and validate data. Integrating MongoDB with
    Express and Node.js allowed me to build a data driven application that persists through launching and shutting down.
    It is able to retrieve information efficiently, reinforcing my understanding of backend development and full stack
    architecture.
    
  </p>
  <p class="prose">
   Developing a security mindset was an important aspect of my growth as a computer science professional.
    I learned to consider different vulnerabilities and different design philosophies during the design phase to eliminate
    as many security risks as possible during the early stages of a project. When designing the enhancements for the capstone
    project I took these into consideration and it influenced the final outcome of the project. Coursework and capstone work
    reinforced this mindset and has taught me the importance of secure data handling, validation and awareness of future system
    changes. When working with databases and server side technologies I applied the best practices to minimize exposure of
    sensitive data and design systems with security and privacy in mind. 

  </p>
  <p class="prose">
   The artifacts included in this ePortfolio were intentionally selected to function as a cohesive representation
    of my growth across the multiple areas of computer science. Each enhancement intentionally builds upon the same core
    application, demonstrating my ability to iteratively improve a system using modern tools and technologies.
    This approach closely mirrors real world development and workflows and introduces the technical artifacts that 
    follow as evidence of my skills and professional readiness. 

  </p>
  <p class="prose">
   Overall completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has prepared 
   me to enter the field as a capable and adaptable software developer. I have strengthened my technical 
   expertise with technologies such as Node.js, Express and MongoDB, refined my communication and collaboration 
   skills and developed confidence in my ability to design secure, efficient and scalable professional projects. 
   I am prepared to contribute meaningfully to professional development teams and continue growing within the field 
   of computer science.
