# Enhancement 1 – Software Design and Engineering

## Overview
This branch contains **Enhancement 1** of my CS-499 Capstone Project.  
The focus of this enhancement is **software design and engineering**, with an emphasis on improving application structure, modularity, and maintainability.

## Purpose of the Enhancement
The goal of this enhancement was to refactor the original application to better align with modern software engineering practices. Improvements were made to code organization, readability, and overall design to support future expansion and enhancements.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express
- JavaScript

## Contents of This Branch
- **Enhanced Application Code**  
  This branch represents the updated version of the application after software design and engineering improvements were applied.

## How to Compare Versions
The original version of the application can be found in the **`Original-Artifact`** branch.  
Additional enhancements are available in the **`Enhancement-2`** and **`Enhancement-3`** branches.


## Course Outcomes Addressed
This enhancement contributes to the following CS-499 course outcomes:

- **Design and evaluate computing solutions** using computer science practices while managing design trade-offs.
- **Demonstrate the use of well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools** to implement computing solutions that deliver value.
