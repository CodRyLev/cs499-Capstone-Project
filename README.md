# Original Artifact

## Overview
This branch contains the **original version** of the application selected for my CS-499 Capstone Project. This version represents the state of the project before any capstone enhancements were applied.

## Purpose
The purpose of this branch is to provide a baseline for comparison against the enhanced versions of the application. No CS-499 course outcomes are demonstrated in this version, as it exists solely to show the starting point prior to enhancement.

## Technologies Used
- Java

## Notes
All capstone enhancements and associated course outcomes are demonstrated in the following branches:
- **Enhancement-1** – Software Design and Engineering
- **Enhancement-2** – Algorithms and Data Structures
- **Enhancement-3** – Databases
