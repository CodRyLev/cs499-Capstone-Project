# Enhancement 2 – Algorithms and Data Structures

## Overview
This branch contains **Enhancement 2** of my CS-499 Capstone Project.  
The focus of this enhancement is **algorithms and data structures**, with an emphasis on improving problem-solving logic, data handling, and clarity of implementation.

## Purpose of the Enhancement
The goal of this enhancement was to evaluate and improve how algorithms and data structures are applied within the application while clearly communicating design decisions and trade-offs. This enhancement emphasizes collaborative development practices and the ability to explain technical solutions to diverse audiences.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- JavaScript

## Contents of This Branch
- **Enhanced Application Code**  
  This branch represents the updated version of the application after algorithmic and structural improvements were applied.

## How to Compare Versions
The original version of the application can be found in the **`Original-Artifact`** branch.  
Additional enhancements are available in the **`Enhancement-1`** and **`Enhancement-3`** branches.

## Course Outcomes Addressed
This enhancement contributes to the following CS-499 course outcomes:

- **Employ strategies for building collaborative environments** that support organizational decision making through clear implementation and review of algorithmic solutions.
- **Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications** by clearly explaining algorithmic approaches, trade-offs, and problem-solving strategies.
