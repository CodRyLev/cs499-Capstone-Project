# Enhancement 3 – Databases

## Overview
This branch contains **Enhancement 3** of my CS-499 Capstone Project.  
The focus of this enhancement is **database integration**, with an emphasis on persistent data storage, backend integration, and secure data handling.

## Purpose of the Enhancement
The goal of this enhancement was to incorporate a database into the application to support persistent data storage and retrieval. This enhancement improves the application’s ability to manage data efficiently while following best practices for backend development and database design. Security considerations were incorporated during the design and implementation process to reduce potential risks and protect data integrity.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- MongoDB Compass

## Contents of This Branch
- **Enhanced Application Code**  
  This branch represents the updated version of the application after database integration and backend enhancements were applied.

## How to Compare Versions
The original version of the application can be found in the **`Original-Artifact`** branch.  
Additional enhancements are available in the **`Enhancement-1`** and **`Enhancement-2`** branches.

## Course Outcomes Addressed
This enhancement contributes to the following CS-499 course outcomes:

- **Demonstrate the use of well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools** to implement computing solutions that deliver value through database integration and backend development.
- **Develop a security mindset** by considering data validation, secure data handling, and potential vulnerabilities during database and server-side design.
